There are two types of locks:

1. Intrinsic:
These are built into every object in java. You don't see them, but they're there. When you use a synchronised keyword,
you're using these automatic locks.

2. Explicit
These are more advanced locks you can control yourself using the Lock class from java.util.concurrent.locks.
You explicitly say when to lock and unlock, giving you more control over how and when people can write in the notebook(for eg).
Eg was many people try writing on the same notebook simultaneously.


so basically to get more control we use explicit locks.



Synchrnoised:
There's no guarantee of,
1. Fairness
2. Blocking
3. Interruptibility.
4. Read/Write locking(But when do manual locking, this thing can be overcomed)
